In my current role as a ABC, I have worked closely with offshore and onsite teams, along with ABC leadership, to ensure smooth delivery and strong outcomes.

Over the past 20 years, here are my key achievement's,

Ownership: Consistently took ownership of assigned tasks, worked closely with the team, and ensured deliverables were completed on time, with quality, and as scheduled.

Customer Feedback: Received positive appreciation and consistent feedback from customers throughout the tenure since joining. Appreciation emails are attached for reference.

Improvements and Ideas: As part of the most recent innovation initiative (December 2000), the ideas presented by my team and me were considered and selected as a project for the upcoming PI, adding value.

Addressing Customer Feedback: Based on the feedback received during the most recent workout session (October 2000), the pain points raised by the customer were addressed and acted upon.

Based on the above contributions, I kindly request consideration for promotion.

Thank you for your time and support.
