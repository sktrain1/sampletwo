Digital Enrollment Platform
Customer Integration & Architecture Guide
1. Document Purpose and Goal
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide end customers with a technical integration and architecture overview of the [Company Name] Digital Enrollment Platform.

This document explains:

How customers connect to the platform

Available API integration models

Enrollment submission structure

Enrollment status retrieval mechanisms

Security and authentication requirements

Operational expectations for integration

Internal system implementation details are intentionally abstracted.

1.2 Goal

The goal of this document is to enable customers to:

Integrate quickly and securely

Understand supported interaction patterns

Submit enrollments using a unified API

Retrieve enrollment status reliably

Onboard with minimal technical dependencies

1.3 Intended Audience

Customer solution architects

Integration and middleware teams

API developers

Security and compliance teams

2. Platform Architecture Overview
2.1 High-Level Architecture Diagram

Insert Customer-Facing Architecture Diagram Here

The diagram illustrates how customer systems interact with the Digital Enrollment Platform using secure REST APIs.
It shows inbound enrollment submissions and outbound or on-demand status retrieval.

2.2 Architecture Overview

At a high level, the platform consists of:

Customer Systems
Applications or middleware submitting enrollments and retrieving status

Digital Enrollment APIs
Secure REST endpoints exposed by [Company Name]

Processing & Automation Layer
Responsible for validating, processing, and managing enrollments

Status Communication Layer
Supports both callback-based and on-demand status retrieval

2.3 Key Architectural Characteristics

REST-based integration

Unified data contract

Secure, token-based authentication

Asynchronous and synchronous communication support

Scalable and resilient processing

3. Supported Integration Models

The platform supports multiple integration models to meet different customer needs.

Model	Enrollment Submission	Status Retrieval	Typical Use Case
Push–Push	REST API	Callback	Fully automated integrations
Push–Pull	REST API	getStatus API	Customer-controlled polling

Customers select the model during onboarding.

4. Security and Access
4.1 Authentication

All APIs are secured using OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant.

Each customer is provided with:

Client ID

Client Secret

Token endpoint

An access token must be included in every API request.

4.2 Transport Security

HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher)

Requests without valid tokens are rejected

Optional IP restrictions may apply

4.3 Data Protection

Sensitive data is protected in transit and at rest

Access is limited to authorized customers

All transactions are logged for audit purposes

5. Enrollment API Overview
5.1 Unified Enrollment Design

The Digital Enrollment Platform exposes single enrollment APIs.

Each request contains:

Account information

Contact information

Enrollment details

There are no separate APIs for individual data entities.

5.2 Enrollment Endpoints

OnerDigitalService

POST /services/apexrest/oner/v1/enrollment


AweDigitalService

POST /services/apexrest/awe/v1/enrollment


The endpoint provided depends on the customer configuration.

6. Enrollment Request Structure
6.1 High-Level Payload Structure
externalReferenceId
sourceSystem
enrollmentType
account
contact
opportunity

6.2 Account Information

The Account section represents the individual or organization associated with the enrollment.

Includes:

Account type

Legal or individual name

Tax or external identifiers

Address information

6.3 Contact Information

The Contact section represents the primary individual associated with the enrollment.

Includes:

Name

Email

Phone

Date of birth (if applicable)

6.4 Enrollment Details

The Opportunity section represents the enrollment request.

Includes:

Product or plan identifiers

Requested effective date

Enrollment channel

7. Enrollment Processing Behavior

Each enrollment request is processed atomically

Validation occurs at submission time

Duplicate submissions are prevented using a unique reference ID

A response is returned immediately indicating receipt or validation errors

8. Enrollment Status Management
8.1 Status Lifecycle

Typical enrollment statuses include:

Received

In Progress

Approved

Rejected

Activated

8.2 Callback-Based Status Updates

For customers using the Push–Push model:

Status updates are sent automatically

Callbacks occur on a scheduled basis

Only changed statuses are transmitted

8.3 On-Demand Status Retrieval

For customers using the Push–Pull model:

Status can be retrieved using a dedicated API

Customers control when status is queried

Supports real-time visibility

Endpoint

GET /services/apexrest/awe/v1/enrollment/status/{externalReferenceId}

9. Error Handling and Response Standards
9.1 Error Response Structure

Error responses include:

Error code

Error description

Field-level details where applicable

9.2 Common Error Scenarios

Authentication failures

Validation errors

Duplicate submissions

System errors

Clear error messages are provided to support troubleshooting.

10. Operational Considerations
10.1 Idempotency

externalReferenceId must be unique

Repeated requests return consistent results

10.2 Performance Expectations

APIs are synchronous

Response times depend on payload size

Bulk submissions are not supported unless explicitly agreed

10.3 Availability

Platform availability aligns with published SLAs

Planned maintenance is communicated in advance

11. Customer Onboarding Process

Contract and security review

Credential provisioning

Integration model selection

Sandbox testing

Production go-live

12. Appendix
