Digital Enrollment Platform
Internal Customer Onboarding Guide

Audience: Onboarding / Implementation Team
Purpose: Standard process for onboarding new API customers

1. Objective

This document defines the step-by-step process for onboarding new customers to the Digital Enrollment Platform, including:

Configuration setup

Credential provisioning

UAT enablement

Production go-live

Monitoring and support handover

The objective is to ensure secure, consistent, and controlled onboarding for every customer.

3. Pre-Onboarding Checklist

Before technical setup begins, confirm:

✅ Commercial agreement executed

✅ Compliance / risk approval received

✅ Integration model confirmed (Pull or Push)

✅ SLA tier defined

✅ Technical contact identified

Proceed only after confirmation from Business/Relationship team.

4. Customer Information Collection

Collect and record the following:

4.1 Mandatory Information

Organization name

Technical contact details

Integration model (Pull / Push)

Target go-live timeline

4.2 If Push Model Selected

Callback endpoint URL

Authentication method (OAuth / mTLS / IP restriction)

Expected batch frequency

Retry requirements (if customized)

4.3 Security Configuration

IP addresses for whitelisting

Public key (if encryption required)

All information must be stored in the onboarding tracker.

5. Internal Setup Activities
5.1 Create OAuth Client

In Authorization Server:

Generate client_id

Generate client_secret

Assign scope: enrollment

Set token expiration policy

Enable UAT access

Store credentials in approved secrets management system.

5.2 API Gateway Configuration

In API Gateway:

Enable client routing

Apply rate limits (if applicable)

Configure IP whitelist (if required)

Enable request logging

Enable correlation ID tracking

5.3 Push Model Configuration (If Applicable)

If Push Model is selected:

Register callback endpoint

Configure outbound authentication

Set batch frequency

Configure retry policy

Enable delivery monitoring alerts

6. Monitoring, Logging & Alerts Setup

Before enabling UAT access, ensure monitoring is configured.

6.1 API Traffic Monitoring

Monitor via:

API Gateway Dashboard

Request count

Success rate

Error rate (4xx / 5xx)

Latency metrics

Application Monitoring Tool (APM)

Processing times

Backend errors

Throughput

6.2 Logging

Ensure logging is enabled in:

API Gateway (request/response logs)

Enrollment Processing System

Batch Push Service (if applicable)

Logs must include:

Correlation ID

Client ID

Timestamp

Status code

Error details (if any)

Verify logs are visible in centralized logging platform (e.g., ELK/Splunk/Cloud Logging).

6.3 Alerts Configuration

Enable alerts for:

High error rate (4xx / 5xx threshold)

Repeated authentication failures

Processing failures

Batch push failures (non-200 response)

System downtime

Ensure alert ownership is assigned (Onboarding / Platform / Support team).

7. UAT Enablement

Provide customer with:

UAT Base URL

OAuth token endpoint

UAT credentials

API documentation

Internally verify:

Client is active

Traffic visible in API Gateway dashboard

Logs are being generated correctly

8. UAT Testing & Certification

During UAT phase:

Customer Responsibilities

Generate access token

Submit test enrollments

Validate status retrieval

Test error scenarios

Validate Push delivery (if applicable)

Internal Responsibilities

Monitor API traffic in Gateway dashboard

Review logs for validation errors

Confirm correct lifecycle transitions

Validate batch delivery (if enabled)

Once testing is successful:

Obtain written confirmation

Update onboarding tracker to “UAT Certified”

9. Production Go-Live
9.1 Production Setup

Create Production client_id and client_secret

Apply Production rate limits

Enable Production routing

Configure Production IP whitelist

Enable Production monitoring & alerts

9.2 Share Production Credentials

Provide credentials via secure channel only.

Never send secrets via plain email.

10. Post Go-Live Monitoring (First 48 Hours)

Monitor closely:

API traffic volume

Error rates

Latency spikes

Enrollment processing failures

Push delivery success rate

Validate:

No abnormal 401/403 errors

No stuck enrollments

No batch retry loops

Escalate anomalies immediately.

11. Enrollment Lifecycle (Reference)
SUBMITTED → VALIDATING → PROCESSING → APPROVED / REJECTED / FAILED


Ensure no enrollments remain in intermediate states beyond SLA thresholds.

12. Support Handover

After stable operation:

Update internal systems with:

Customer name

Integration model

Go-live date

Credential reference ID

Notify Support team with:

SLA tier

Monitoring dashboard location

Alert ownership

Special configurations

Transition monitoring responsibility to Support.

13. Offboarding / Credential Rotation

If required:

Revoke OAuth client

Disable API access

Disable push configuration

Archive logs per retention policy
