1. Introduction

Welcome to the [Your Company Name] Digital Enrollment Platform.

This guide explains how to integrate your system to:

Submit digital enrollment requests

Retrieve enrollment status on demand (Pull Model)

Receive automated status updates (Push Model)

All APIs are secured using OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials Grant).

This document is designed to enable quick and seamless onboarding.

Welcome to the [Your Company Name] Digital Enrollment Platform.

Our Digital Enrollment APIs provide secure, scalable integration for submitting and processing enrollments. They support real-time and scheduled workflows for seamless connection with your applications, portals, or backend systems.

Through this integration, you can:

Submit digital enrollment requests

Retrieve enrollment status on demand (Pull Model)

Receive automated status updates through scheduled batch notifications (Push Model)

All APIs follow REST principles, use JSON payloads over HTTPS, and are secured using OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials Grant).

This guide provides the information needed for onboarding, authentication, API usage, and status handling to help your teams integrate quickly and efficiently.

2. High-Level Architecture

[Placeholder: Insert Architecture Diagram Here]

Integration Overview

Your system authenticates using OAuth 2.0.

You submit an enrollment request.

We process the enrollment.

You retrieve the final status via:

API call (Pull), or

Scheduled batch push (Push).

3. Onboarding Process

To begin integration, please complete the following steps.

3.1 Agreement & Access

Execute required commercial and legal agreements.

Confirm preferred status retrieval model (Pull or Push).

3.2 One-Time Configuration

Prior to API enablement, please provide:

Organization name

Technical & operational contact details

IP addresses for whitelisting (if required)

Callback endpoint URL (for Push model)

Public key (if applicable)

This is a one-time setup requirement.

3.3 Credential Provisioning

After configuration approval, we will provide:

client_id

client_secret

OAuth token endpoint

API Base URLs (UAT & Production)

Testing instructions

3.4 UAT Testing

In UAT environment:

Generate OAuth token

Submit test enrollments

Validate status retrieval

Complete sign-off

3.5 Production Go-Live

After successful UAT certification:

Production credentials will be activated.

Production endpoints will be enabled.

4. API Access & Integration Flow

This section describes the complete operational sequence from authentication to status retrieval.

4.1 Environment Details
Environment	Base URL
UAT	https://uat-api.yourcompany.com

Production	https://api.yourcompany.com

All endpoints below are relative to the base URL of your assigned environment.

4.2 Authentication – OAuth 2.0

All API calls require a valid Bearer access token.

We use OAuth 2.0 – Client Credentials Grant.

Step 1 – Generate Access Token
Endpoint
POST /oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Request Parameters
grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
&scope=enrollment

Sample Response
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}

Usage

Include the token in all API calls:

Authorization: Bearer {access_token}


Generate a new token when the existing one expires.

4.3 Enrollment Submission
Step 2 – Submit Enrollment
Endpoint
POST /v1/enrollments

Headers
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
Content-Type: application/json

Sample Request
{
  "requestId": "REQ123456",
  "customerId": "CUST10001",
  "productCode": "DIGI001",
  "applicant": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-05-10",
    "email": "john.doe@email.com",
    "phone": "+15551234567"
  },
  "address": {
    "line1": "123 Main Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10001",
    "country": "US"
  }
}

Sample Response
{
  "enrollmentId": "ENR789456",
  "requestId": "REQ123456",
  "status": "SUBMITTED",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-12T10:15:30Z"
}


Store the enrollmentId for tracking.

4.4 Enrollment Processing & Status Lifecycle

Each enrollment progresses through the following states:

SUBMITTED → VALIDATING → PROCESSING → APPROVED / REJECTED / FAILED

Status	Description
SUBMITTED	Request received
VALIDATING	Data validation
PROCESSING	Business evaluation
APPROVED	Enrollment successful
REJECTED	Business rule rejection
FAILED	Technical/system issue
4.5 Status Retrieval Options

You may retrieve status using one of the following models.

Option A – On-Demand Status (Pull Model)
Endpoint
GET /v1/enrollments/{enrollmentId}

Headers
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}

Sample Response
{
  "enrollmentId": "ENR789456",
  "requestId": "REQ123456",
  "status": "APPROVED",
  "statusReason": "All validations passed",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-02-12T10:20:45Z"
}

Real-time applications

UI-based systems

Immediate decision display

Option B – Scheduled Status Updates (Push Model)

Instead of polling, you may opt for automated status updates.

Process Flow

Provide callback endpoint during onboarding.

Our scheduled batch process compiles updated enrollments.

Status payload is sent to your endpoint.

Your system must return HTTP 200.

Sample Push Payload
{
  "batchId": "BATCH20260212",
  "generatedAt": "2026-02-12T11:00:00Z",
  "enrollments": [
    {
      "enrollmentId": "ENR789456",
      "requestId": "REQ123456",
      "status": "APPROVED",
      "lastUpdated": "2026-02-12T10:20:45Z"
    }
  ]
}

Expected Response
HTTP 200 OK


Retries apply in case of non-success response, as per SLA.

5. Error Handling
Standard Error Format
{
  "errorCode": "INVALID_REQUEST",
  "errorMessage": "Missing required field: customerId",
  "correlationId": "CORR123456",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-12T10:15:35Z"
}

Common HTTP Status Codes
Code	Meaning
200	Success
400	Invalid Request
